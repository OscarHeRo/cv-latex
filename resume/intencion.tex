Dear Hiring Committee,

My name is \textbf{Oscar David Hernández Rodríguez}, and I am a Computer Science student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), currently entering the final year of my undergraduate program. I am writing to express my strong interest in the \textbf{Technology - Cash Equities Intern} position at J.P. Morgan in Mexico City.

Throughout my academic and project experience, I have developed a solid foundation in software development, with particular focus on databases (PL/SQL, MySQL), scripting (Python, Bash), and basic deployment using tools like Git and Jenkins. I have also worked on low-level programming, concurrent systems, and object-oriented applications, which has helped me understand how to build and maintain reliable codebases.

I’m especially interested in this role because it connects my programming skills with real systems used in the financial world. The idea of helping to maintain and improve the tools that allow trading to work reliably in Mexico and globally is something concrete and exciting to me. I want to keep learning about how large systems are built and maintained in practice.

I am fluent in English and Spanish, and I believe I can contribute both technically and collaboratively to your team. Thank you for your consideration.
